The poison is the dose. In the right amounts, and directed, poison can achieve things.
Things that damage you can be good for you. 
Exercise the act of systematically damaging your body. Exercise does not make you strong. Rest and food are the things that repair you.
Anything in the wrong amounts is a poison for you. The trick is finding the amount that is correct of anything that is correct.
For some things it is zero and never. For other things it is some, all the time. /pu
