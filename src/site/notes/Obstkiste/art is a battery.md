Art is like a battery, it stores energy and transmits it across time and space.

---

Itâ€™s better than a battery because the energy never diminishes

---

Art is a reservoir of emotions, ideas and cultural energy, cultural value.

The more [[Obstkiste/energy\|energy]] you put into a container and repeat it, the stronger that it becomes, and the strength is cumulative. 

---

At a certain point the energy inside the [[Obstkiste/container\|container]] means that it has [[Obstkiste/density\|Obstkiste/density]]. This means it is more than the original materials used to make it. [[Obstkiste/density\|Obstkiste/density]] is only added [[Obstkiste/by hand\|by hand]]. 

---

When there is enough [[Obstkiste/density\|Obstkiste/density]] it will reach [[Obstkiste/critical mass\|critical mass]]. This means that the [[Obstkiste/container\|container]] is full.


---

Full containers can transform into other containers.

Antithesis
Art is ephemeral and subjective. It could be said that the energy invested in creating art is limited to the artist. Removed from the original [[Obstkiste/context\|context]] the original energy may dissipate and only reflect a shifting of paradigms and ideas of its time.
