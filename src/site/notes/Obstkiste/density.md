Density is resolved [ambiguity](ambiguity.md). 
Density is a pattern of facts that have [coherence](coherence.md). 

---

When enough density is created the project reaches [critical mass](critical%20mass.md).

---

Density is earned by resolving ambiguity. 

Concept of realness, of weight, of *being* in art. A real thing. Through correct form it becomes more than the ingredients used to make it. 
Solidity.
Verisimilitude. 

Realness, not photorealism.

Not the idea of heaviness
weight, substance, density, *heft*
Hardness

It is not just physical things that can have density
- basslines
- plots
