Ambiguity is a superposition. There are many possible states for it to be resolved.

It is not the same thing as chaos, although I don't know enough about chaos to be really sure about this.

Ambiguity is resolved by:
- making decisions about things
- time - this is the part that confuses me. Because if situations can resolve themselves over time then in some cases entropy could be said to be reducing over time.
- logic: if A then B. B is resolved.

#Q :: When ambiguity is resolved, does it become [density](Obstkiste/density.md)?

A designer resolves a certain type of ambiguity. Lawyers also resolve a particular type of ambiguity. 


[[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]] is something that is resolved by the mind. The future is unresolved. The mind moving through time creates a reality and resolves the chaos and ambiguity of the future into the present.

Ambiguity is the chaotic world of [[Obstkiste/energy\|energy]]. Resolution of [[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]] is pattern recognition.

- somewhere in [[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]] is [[Obstkiste/meaning\|meaning]]
- [[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]] is unresolved [[Obstkiste/meaning\|meaning]]

[[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]] comes in different varieties. Specific ambiguity is related to clearly defined problems. Diffuse ambiguity is related to problems that are not clearly defined

Is it possible to get comfortable with [[Obstkiste/Decision Brownout\|Decision Brownout]], with [[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]]? Those that do are able to move through chaotic situations with ease.
Drawing is like this. It starts with an infinite state, and there is no right or wrong answer. It's not something that really ever be solved. With drawing then you get comfortable with ambiguous situations. The end of a drawing can be ambiguous. Is any art truly finished? Or just abandoned. Maybe it's drawing as well you should post up.
Just like anything, it's not the things that you have, it's what you do with them.

The Ambiguity between jobs  
The anxiety that comes from this time  
The worst thing you can do is nothing and so you freeze because it's impossible to decide what it should be  
Any rescue from ambiguity is welcome  
The pressure to be productive causes nothing productive
