A brand could be described as a container that holds a consistent set of beliefs. 

Modern brands follow the same cultural pathways as religious iconography. The values associated with brands are a collective hallucination. There is no way that brands can actually embody these things - because brands are no more real than any god - both are powered by human belief. Take away the belief in the brand and it is nothing. It's vibes all the way down.
That is not to diminish the power of belief in any way, it is a powerful thing.

From the point of view of a designer working on established brands, assets are to be treated as religious artefacts. 
Do not change or misrepresent them. The heraldry is sacred, and must not be interfered with, should the meaning of the brand be somehow lost.

Priests understand the inner secrets of the brand and engage in constructing elaborate artefacts that are only seen by the inner circle of initiates. The creation of a Brand Book is a religious activity and is used to align the work of contractors with the brand message.
Priests carry out conversations about 'what the brand is really about'. Factions dispute over the true meaning of the values of the brand akin to debates of the number of celestial feet may frolic upon a piece of haberdashery.

Brand Guardians are priests
They understand the inner secrets of the brand and how it must be presented and shown to the world
