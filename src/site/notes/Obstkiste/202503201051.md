Holding thoughts in your body as tension. Just as the mind makes thoughts real, the body makes the thoughts real. Thoughts come from the body because the mind comes from the body. The head is not the only place where information and history is stored. Your body shows the history of it - we are all just piles of food. The body remembers old injuries. The autonomic system reacts without the head being involved. Pavlovian responses. Memories and tension are held in the body by the mind holding the body or muscles in positions without conscious thought.

Maybe we can directly influence these stress positions with consciously relaxing the neck. Maybe we can tell ourselves a story about how it is there or why it is there. It's not having pain, it is what you do with it.

Better a good act comes from hate than a selfish act from love.

There is a tension in all of us between 'wanting to know' and 'not wanting to know'. There are some things we would rather not know about, and some things we want to know everything about.
