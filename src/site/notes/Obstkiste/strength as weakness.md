Every strength has a corresponding weakness
Every weakness is a strength in disguise

Each attribute is a double edged sword
A trait's value lies not in itself, but its application

What you assume Is strength is weakness  
What you assume is weakness is strength

People get addicted to the rewards that their strengths bring
An addiction is a weakness and can be leveraged
Leveraging someone's weakness will make them hate you
Leveraging someone’s strength is much easier
– after Venkatesh Rao

We are all individuals, and we all have qualities that distinguish ourselves from each other. We can think of these qualities in certain ways. All weaknesses can become strengths, and strengths weaknesses. It just depends how you look at your qualities, and the qualities of others.

Being good at a language vs having no language

Knowledge vs Intelligence. A child starts with no language, and the brain is shaped and becomes less plastic as language is acquired
