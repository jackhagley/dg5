It's important to sometimes choose to have no purpose. This means saying "the plan is no plan". Not everything is a goal to be achieved or a target to be hit. To think like this is to reduce life to a series of boxes to be ticked. Work will never be completed, because like life, it is a process. 



It is unfashionable to have no purpose. To explicitly reject the idea of goals.
Muscles must rest

To choose to step outside of work

Many things around purposelessness need to be set before purposelessness can happen.

A balance between unstructured and structured time.
Places such as nightclubs, festivals, parks and the living spaces in your house are important because they provide spaces that are open ended in terms of experiences. Yes, you can go to them with the intention of achieving something, or with a goal in mind but they are totally different from places like the cinema or a sports game. These are highly structured around events and therefore time. 
The internet itself offers too much unstructured time with things like video feeds
