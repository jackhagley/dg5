### What is the easiest way to start [[Obstkiste/actually writing\|actually writing]]?

#### Use Google Docs
share it with 
	- jackhagley@gmail.com
	- mvxkxvzxh@gmail.com

Google Docs is good because:
- You can work on it anywhere
- It has less distracting things than EXOMERGE
- It feels different somehow to work on it there
- It's basically ready to go after that
- No obsidian and mark-up to clean out
- highlighting

> ## The Feeling That We Should Have Done It Years Ago
> 
> Hugh Howey is now a full-time writer. He now writes novels that sell millions of copies worldwide. His stories now get honored with prestigious awards, optioned by celebrated filmmakers, and adapted into hit TV shows. ‚ÄúBut for 20 years,‚Äù Hugh said, he was in the bog: ‚Äúfrom age 12 to 32, I tried to write novels and short stories and gave up every time. For 20 years!‚Äù An avid reader, when he began trying to write, Hugh compared his writing to the quality of writing in his favorite books. The quality gap ‚Äúdrove me nuts,‚Äù Hugh said. ‚ÄúI'd write a chapter or 2 before walking away in disgust.‚Äù To try to close that disgusting gap, Hugh stopped fiction and began studying it. He didn't just read novels‚Äîhe dissected, analyzed, and wrote reviews about them. He interviewed authors. He went to conferences and book festivals. As the years went by, more than being disgusted by the quality of his writing, Hugh became increasingly bogged down by regret, by the feeling that the period of his life in which he was best positioned to pursue a writing career was years and years in the past. He had a full-time job, other hobbies, family and friends‚Äîit felt like his life had settled into a knee-deep bog that would take something drastic to get out of. ‚ÄúOften,‚Äù [he said](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4uvoxom5vivh8dwrmqu6h6340gggtl/qvh8h7hr9m83d8al/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0cy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUta25vd2xlZGdlLXByb2plY3Qtd2l0aC1zaGFuZS1wYXJyaXNoL2lkOTkwMTQ5NDgxP2k9MTAwMDQ0NjI4MDA2Mg==), ‚Äúthe feeling that we can‚Äôt break our stasis and launch our lives in a different direction is really due to the feeling that we should have done it five or ten or twenty years ago.‚Äù Then, at the 2009 Virginia Festival of the Book, he got advice ‚Äúthat finally broke 20 years of not writing.‚Äù In a Q&A session with the mystery novelist Caroline Todd, an audience member asked, ‚ÄúHow do I write my first novel?‚Äù Todd stood up, slapped the table, and shouted, ‚ÄúYou stop thinking about writing. You stop dreaming about writing. You stop talking about writing. And you just write. You sit down and you write!‚Äù When Todd ‚Äúyelled‚Äînot even at me, basically near me‚Äîto just write,‚Äù Hugh said he realized that instead of doing something drastic, he could ‚Äústart nudging his life in a new direction,‚Äù by simply writing a little before work and on his lunch break. He analogized it to sailing around the world. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get to where you want to be in one day,‚Äù he says, ‚Äújust like you don‚Äôt sail around the world in a day. You just look at the horizon and say, ‚ÄòI can sail that far.‚Äô Sailing around the world is just sailing to the horizon over and over again. Writing a novel is just writing a sentence over and over again.‚Äù In the margins of his day, Hugh began writing a sentence or two. By doing that over and over again, he said, ‚ÄúI accumulated a lot of words, and in a five or six year period, I wrote about 15 novels.‚Äù

##### Keep writing until there's nothing left.
##### (There's always something left)

The idea is to simply *be*, to write not with the idea to *become* anything or *show off* to anyone. 

Mechanically practice writing until you have insane muscle memory connecting the brain and the words fizz off the fingers.


Being sure that the right thing to do is simply to write and publish and write and publish until the direction becomes clear.

Any place is a good place for *actually writing*. Any time you're sitting and thinking about it and using a way to record things.

Rule system is emergent
Temporary rules for set pieces or desired outcomes

---

compress concepts, expand themes
When you know enough about something to be able to express it simply, it can then be unfolded in different ways depending on situation, media and audience.

Writing strategically: writing with an aim or an audience in mind. This is especially true in [social media](social%20media.md). 

Any time the process is painful and hard. Everything worth doing requires some measure of concentration. Perhaps there are people who find it easy. It is a road that has hills and valleys. Some times it's easy to go down a gradient, and other times every word is a struggle. 

The truth perhaps is that I always should have been writing, that this is where I feel like myself. I feel like I can see myself on the page.

I was writing an essay on epistemology and design. I should pick it up again. I dodged myself out of it. I talked myself out of it. I outsmarted myself into avoidance. I'd rather write words of pedantry than get into something hard like that. Pedantry is a big source of procrastination. If procrastination has an emotional origin, then pedantry does too.

Perhaps I will just have an open note for the day and then put things in it as I go along and think of things? Perhaps there will be

I should be mindful that writing here in a blog that nobody will really read stops one important side of online writing -- feedback loops. It's hard to know whether or not something resonates with anyone if you are forever shouting into the void. The exercise at the moment however is just getting used to the habit of writing and publishing. The exercise is just to remove the friction between writing and getting things out there. Perhaps it is cowardly to do it this way and almost avoid eyes.

I feel that my life could have been different if I'd searched out more contemporaries to work alongside. I always wanted to do things my own way, to isolate myself. There was no-one to keep me honest and keep me on-track. Things are easy to dodge when there is no one there to keep you on the path. Dodging is something people do to get out of doing something. The intellect will always be there to invent a path away from something unpleasant. It can be relied upon to do that. 

Pedantry is the curse of my life. The way that I dodge things is by getting caught up in small details. I work on tiny parts of a whole and neglect the parts that mean delivery. I notice this pattern in my life again and again. Sometimes the details are important, but more important is getting things done and getting things out. Shipping things is part of the feedback loop.

Just enormously frustrated trying to get the blog actually working. Using GPT to code is sometimes good and sometimes it sucks. I think it's a lot to do with the computer I am using as well. The smaller computer is good for more writing based tasks as it has less distractions. It has less big screens and this prevents having too many things open at once. The downside of this is that there is a lot of switching between windows that can get extremely repetitive. There are a lot of shortcuts and things like that to remember. 

~

I'm feeling extremely frustrated with things. I feel like I am rushing perhaps. That getting into doing things takes a long time. That I'm not sure what it is that I should be doing when even get there. This leads to a feeling that I often have that I am wasting my time with whatever I am doing. Whatever I am doing seems to be the wrong thing to do. This has to do with my individual tolerance for ambiguity. There is a [tension](tension.md) there between the system and freedom. If there was a system I would quickly become sick of it and rebel against it. If there is no system at all then I feel uncomfortable in the ambiguity. Ultimately however it is not whether there is a system at all that is the issue, it is how one chooses to see things.

Another tension: between that which strives, and that which surrenders. To strive is to actively enforce will upon the universe. To surrender is to let yourself be carried by outside forces. The striving is externalising thought, the surrender is internalising the universe. Perhaps then it is like breath itself, a constant intercourse between these things. A skilful person could turn this interplay into a dance. 

---

Imagine a state on a gradient that runs from chaos to order, or structure to rupture. Then orthogonal to this a gradient from surrender to strive. It seems an unhappy place to be striving in [[Obstkiste/ambiguity\|ambiguity]], but this is where I often seem to find myself.
